-----------------------------------------------Welcome to our application----------------------------------------------

**Note: because the main purpose of visualization is to help user understand how the algorithm works,
we put some restriction to our application:
  1. Only non-negative numbers are accepted
  2. The array size is fixed at 8.


Sort screen (on the top left of the screen):
* You can:
  - Choose to either:

    + Randomize input. 
    
    + Input your own array in the text field at the bottom of the screen.
		The array have to be entered in comma separated form (eg: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Control bar (at the bottom of the screen):
	* From left to right:
  	- A text field to input your array
  
  	- A "Start" button: start the sorting visualization.
		 
  - A "Restart" button: go back to your first view (initial array).
  
  - A "Skip" button: to go to the last view (sorted array).
 
  - A text area to display the instant step of the algorithm.
